2. Keystroke Dynamics: As a user, I want the software to study my typing pattern when I register on the website.  (Estimated Time - 20 days) (Priority 10)
3. Encryption: As a user, I want my typing pattern data to be secured. (Estimated Time - 2 days) (Priority 20)
4. Authentication Phase 1: As a user, I want to be able to use a secondary authentication to login to the website if I am unable to match the typing pattern. (Estimated Time - 2 days) (Priority 30)
5. Authentication Phase 2: As a user, I want to see the secondary authentication showing just a set of images that I choose from. (Estimated Time - 4 days) (Priority 30)
6. Authentication Phase 3: As a user, I want to choose the number of images and the sequence of images as a secondary authentication. (Estimated Time - 3 days) (Priority 30)
7. Notification: As a user, I want to receive an email when my credentials are used to log into the website but the typing pattern doesn't match my typing patter.  (Estimated Time - 5 days) (Priority 50)
8. Password Retrieval: As a user, I want to be able to reset my password if and when I forget by getting a code in my email.  (Estimated Time - 3 days) (Priority 40)
